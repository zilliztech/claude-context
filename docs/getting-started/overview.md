# Project Overview

## What is Code Context?

Code Context is a powerful semantic code search tool that gives AI coding assistants deep understanding of your entire codebase. Instead of traditional keyword-based search, Code Context uses vector embeddings and AI to understand the meaning and context of your code.

## Key Features

### üîç Semantic Code Search
Ask natural language questions like "find functions that handle user authentication" and get relevant code snippets from across your entire codebase.

### üß† Context-Aware Understanding
Discover relationships between different parts of your code, even across millions of lines. The system understands code structure, patterns, and dependencies.

### ‚ö° Incremental Indexing
Efficiently re-index only changed files using Merkle trees, making it fast to keep your search index up-to-date.

### üß© Intelligent Code Chunking
Uses Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) to intelligently split code into meaningful chunks that preserve context and structure.

### üóÑÔ∏è Scalable Architecture
Integrates with Zilliz Cloud for scalable vector search, handling codebases of any size.

### üõ†Ô∏è Highly Customizable
Configure file extensions, ignore patterns, embedding models, and search parameters to fit your specific needs.

## How It Works

### 1. Code Analysis
Code Context analyzes your codebase using AST parsers to understand code structure and semantics.

### 2. Intelligent Chunking
Code is split into meaningful chunks that preserve context, function boundaries, and logical groupings.

### 3. Vector Embeddings
Each code chunk is converted into high-dimensional vectors using state-of-the-art embedding models.

### 4. Vector Storage
Embeddings are stored in a vector database (Milvus/Zilliz Cloud) for efficient similarity search.

### 5. Semantic Search
Natural language queries are converted to vectors and matched against stored code embeddings.
